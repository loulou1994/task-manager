# Task Manager Script

A simple and basic task management program to keep track of the casual daily tasks a common person may have.
The code was written in **bash scripting** language. A first for the developer that I am to write any script code.
The experience was enjoyable and beneficial. I learned a lot during the project including manipulating the cli and prompting in the terminal as well as getting myself used to the bash syntax.
